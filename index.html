            <h1>Hi, I'm Alyssa Plan.</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer and aspiring game designer based in the Tri-State area. I graduated from Rutgers University in 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science, a minor in English, a certificate in Creative Writing, and an insatiable craving for Taylor ham/pork roll. 
                When I'm not writing software, I'm usually making pixel art, writing music, or collecting hackathon stickers.
